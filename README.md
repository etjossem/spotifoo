Spotifoo
=====================

A basic app that allows the user to enter the name of a musician or band and retrieve metadata from the open Spotify API. Tapping/clicking an artist will display top ten tracks, ranked by popularity.

To run on a basic webserver:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

Spotifoo *should* run on both iOS and Android as well! Use at your own risk, they're totally untested because this was made in 3 hours.
